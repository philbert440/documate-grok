# Hobbies
These are the things I like to do in my free time.

## Bass Guitar
Not great or anything but I enjoy it.

## Custom Keyboards
been getting into that in recent years.

## HOTAS Chair setup
and other Flight sim type games as well

## 3D Printing and Making stuff
Sourced and built a Voron Switchwire.
You can find most of the things I've made on printables.
