# Microsoft
I managed to make a name for myself as someone who could handle complexity well and move quickly, and there were a handful of crazy projects and situations that I was brought into get resolved and across the finish line. Some of them include:
- [Sands Casino Hack](/projects#sands-casino-hack)
- [Nokia Aquisition](/projects#microsoft-acquires-nokia)
- [Adobe](/projects#adobe-on-microsoft)
- [Netflix](/projects#netflix-in-2013)

You can read the full story of how I ended up there and what I did there below.

After finish college I really wanted to work at Google, after applying to different positions about 15 times, I finally got an interview and made it all the way through the process was flown out to Google HQ for a final interview. The interview went great but it was between me and one other person and unfortunately they picked the other person. The hiring manager sent me some other positions they had open that I would be a good fit for, but I decided to apply for a job at Microsoft while I waited to start the Google process again. As luck would have it November 2011 I was offered the position at Microsoft on the first attempt, and given my recent excitment and interest in MultiTouch devices, and Microsoft just having acquired Perceptive Pixel and now becoming the sole patent holder for the tech, I decided to go with them and see if I could eventually get over to that team and help push it out into the market and see the concept for Pheon Technologies make it to reality.

While there and going through initial training and learning the ropes at MSFT. I persued the goal of finding out what was going to happen with the Perceptive Pixel acquisition, even getting as far as pitching and discussing my ideas for brining the tech to market with Steve Ballmer, CEO at the time. We went back and forth over text messages, but he ultimately let me know that they would probably just sit on the IP until someone else does something with it and then charge them licensing fees. With that in mind coming directly from the CEO I decided that was a dead end and instead decided to focus my career on this cloud thing that really started taking off.

While working at Microsoft I worked with many enterprise organizations deploying cloud infrastructure.
