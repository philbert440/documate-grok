# Adapify Inc
Adapify is a startup, founded in March of 2014 along with 3 friends Josh Lee, Jeff Sheets, and Neil Wood. 

## We Evolve Us - The early years
Initially we began building a concept local social network for organizing and crowdfunding community projects. After quickly realizing the cost of development and operations, and the primary user base being made up of volunteer organizations and small non profits with very little revenue we had to pivot, and find a profitable business model.

The team quickly put together 5 MVPs for SaaS platforms for different industry segments based on what had been built so far and picked up a pilot customer for each. A marketing agency, a co-working space, a youth sports club, a lawn and garden retailer, local city parks and rec department. We found traction with the youth sports team handling payments, scheduling, team assignments, and facilities management. Also we had found an interesting side project with the lawn and garden business, that eventually lead to RxSoil.
