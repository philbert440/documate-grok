# Work Experience During and Before College
Now we're getting back into the old jobs now ones I had during college and during the couple of years before going to college, and if you get down to the bottom of this list you'll find summer jobs I worked when I was in high school back to my first ever job.

## 1901 Group
1901 Group was a managed services startup operating out of Virginia Tech's Corporate Research Center, it was a fun job where I got to dive deeping into the Network Security side of things.

## Genworth Financial
My 1st official job in the tech industry that I didn't start myself. I work Level 2 Software Apps Support and Development, built some scripts to automate some things, wrote some documentation, and worked with between the front line support and the Sys Admins.
