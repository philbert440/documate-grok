# Work Experience During and Before College
Below is a summary of jobs I did during and before college from summer gigs in high school to starting with my first job in the tech industry.

## 1901 Group
At this managed services startup in Virginia Tech’s Corporate Research Center, I dove into network security, gaining hands-on experience in a dynamic, tech-driven environment.

## Genworth Financial
My first official role in the tech industry, working as a Level 2 Software Applications Support and Development specialist. I built automation scripts, wrote documentation, and bridged communication between frontline support and system administrators.

## Phil-Tech
My first entrepreneurial venture, a sole proprietorship focused on freelance tech consulting and building/selling custom computers. In my first year, I earned $20,000, which inspired me to pursue a bachelor’s degree to further my education.

## Phil’s MTG Cards
As a high school freshman and sophomore, I ran an unofficial business buying Magic: The Gathering card collections on eBay, selling them to classmates, and hosting after-school tournaments. I also built my first website, enabling a few online sales.

## Early Jobs
Before entering the tech world, I held various roles, including barista at Starbucks, factory worker at a Pepsi plant, customer service representative at HSN, electronics salesperson, and team member at several fast-food restaurants.
