# Branding Brand
::: warning NOTE:
Unfortunately, I am under an NDA so I can't discuss everything in detail but I will try to give a general overview of the work I did there and the impact it had on the company.
:::

At Branding Brand I led the team that built [Shipcode](https://shipcode.com) from the ground up.

## The Integrations Team and Flagship
When I started at Branding Brand in 2021, I joined the R&D department as the Senior Engineering Manager leading the integrations team. The team was comprised of 4-6 engineers.

## The Product Team and Shipcode
At Branding Brand I Led a team of 9 engineers to design and build a real-time, collaborative app builder, integrating with any backend, achieving 99.9% uptime and real-time alerting and performance monitoring. Implemented CI/CD pipelines and developer tooling, enabling local builds and on-demand QA cloud environments for each pull request, and staging and production. Spearheaded the companyâ€™s shift from an agency to a product-focused model, aligning technology with strategic goals and driving adoption by multiple global enterprise clients.
