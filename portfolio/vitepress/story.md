# My Story

## Childhood
I was born in Corning, NY, the 2nd oldest of 6 boys and no girls. Thankfully I grew up with understanding parents, as I was the tinkerer of the family and more than once took things apart like the VCR to figure out how they worked and most of the time got it back together. I remember having to tell my parents I accidently wiped the family computer while learning about drive partitions. When I wasn't doing that I was often on adventures with my brothers building tree forts and running around outside as kids did in the 90s.

## High School
Paintball war with William Sharner when I was 16.
Built my first website to sell Magic the Gathering cards and hosted tournaments after school.

## Life and Starting My 1st Business
Moved out on my own at 17 and started figuring out what I wanted to do with my life. Eventually that led me to start my first real business building custom computers and made $20k my first year.

## Back to School The College Years
Roanoke, made some lifelong friends.
Took the LCD matrix out of my TV to build a multi-touch table and bought a projector to build a multi-touch wall in my apartment while working full-time to put myself through full-time college. I didn't sleep much.
