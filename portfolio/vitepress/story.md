# My Story
Hello, I'm Philip Robert Tompkins. I am 37 years old. I'm a US Citizen. I've never held security clearance, but am eligable to obtain it. I've been on many adventures and hope to be on many more in the years to come. I have a passion for leading technical teams and building useful things that scale.

## Childhood
I was born September 18th 1987, in Corning, NY, the 2nd oldest of 6 boys and no girls. Thankfully I grew up with understanding parents, as I was the tinkerer of the family and more than once took things apart like the VCR to figure out how they worked and most of the time got the things back together. I remember having to tell my parents I accidently wiped the family computer while learning about hard drive partitions. When I wasn't doing that I was often on adventures with my brothers building tree forts and running around outside as kids did in the 90s.

## High School
Paintball war with William Sharner when I was 16.
Built my first website to sell Magic the Gathering cards and hosted tournaments after school.

## Life and Starting My 1st Business
Moved out on my own at 17 and started figuring out what I wanted to do with my life. Eventually that led me to start my first actual business building custom computers and made $20k my first year. I quickly realized I needed more education to properly build and run a company but knew that was something I wanted to do with my life.

## Back to School The College Years
And so I started working on getting my Bachelor of Science in Management Information Systems.
While going to college in Roanoke,VA I made some lifelong friends, and worked on some moee fun projects. One of them [Pheon Tech](/projects.html#pheon-technologies-group) involved me removing the LCD matrix out of my TV to build a multi-touch table and bought a projector to build a multi-touch wall in my apartment while working full-time to put myself through full-time college. I didn't sleep much.

## Early Career
Microsoft gave me the experience of seeing inside and contributing 1st hand to many large enterprise IT organizations.

## The Startup Years
From We Evolve Us to Adapify to Shipcode, the startup world is full of exciting projects to grow skills at a greatly increased pace.

## Meeting My Wife
Eventually met my best friend, fell in love, and married her in 2017. This is probably my greatest success because it lead to the next part.

## Building A Family
In 2018, we welcomed our daughter Rose into the world and in 2023, our son Keai. We also have a 130lb Great Pyrenees named Bear, and a cat named Eevee.
