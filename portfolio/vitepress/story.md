## About Me
I’m a 37-year-old U.S. citizen with a passion for leading technical teams and building scalable, impactful solutions. With a Bachelor of Science in Management Information Systems, I’ve spent over a decade navigating the dynamic worlds of enterprise IT and startups, honing my expertise in technology and leadership. Eligible for security clearance, I’m driven by curiosity, innovation, and a desire to create meaningful systems. I live with my wife, two children, a Great Pyrenees named Bear, and a cat named Eevee, balancing a fulfilling family life with my professional ambitions.

## Early Life
Born on September 18, 1987, in Corning, NY, I grew up as the second eldest of six brothers in a supportive family. A natural tinkerer, I often disassembled household electronics—like the family VCR—to understand how they worked, occasionally reformatting the family computer in my quest to learn. My childhood was filled with outdoor adventures, building tree forts, and embracing the freedom of the 1990s.

## Entrepreneurial Beginnings
At 17, I moved out and launched my first business, building custom computers and earning $20,000 in my first year. This experience sparked my entrepreneurial drive but underscored the need for further education to scale a company effectively. In high school, I also built a website to sell Magic: The Gathering cards and organized after-school tournaments, showcasing my early knack for blending technology and business.

## Education
I earned a Bachelor of Science in Management Information Systems from a college in Roanoke, VA. During this time, I balanced full-time work with my studies, forging lifelong friendships and tackling ambitious projects. One notable endeavor involved repurposing an LCD matrix from a TV to create a multi-touch table and using a projector to build a multi-touch wall in my apartment—an early testament to my innovative spirit.

## Professional Journey
My career spans enterprise IT and the fast-paced startup ecosystem. At Microsoft, I gained firsthand experience contributing to large-scale enterprise IT organizations, sharpening my technical and strategic skills. Later, in the startup world, I founded Adapify and led a team at Branding Brand to develop Shipcode, working across diverse technology stacks. These experiences strengthened my ability to lead teams, adapt to challenges, and deliver scalable solutions.
